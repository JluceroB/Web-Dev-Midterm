                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello everyone, my name is Albert Einstein and I am known as one of the most 
                    renowned theoretical physicist in history. I was born in Germany on March 14th of 1879, 
                    and later moved to Switzerland in 1895. In 1903 I obtained a position at the Swiss Patent Office. 
                    I also eventually moved to Berlin and both the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. 
                    I also resided in the United States beginning in 1933 and remained there due to the crimes being committed against Jews during Hitlerâ€™s rule. 
                    One of my most major accomplishments include receiving the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.

            <p>
                During my time in the present, I have thrilled to have seen all the new advancements 
                that have been made in both my field but also in many other areas. 
                I am overjoyed to know modern technologies such as the global positioning system (GPS) 
                and speeding detectors were able to be created with the my work on the theory of relativity.

                Aside from my work, I also had quite a few hobbies which includes doing puzzles, 
                reading books, and playing violin.
